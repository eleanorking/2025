**DATASCI 406: Computational Methods in Statistics and Data Science**

This course introduces basic computational methods as needed in statistics. Selected topics in statistical computing, including basic numerical aspects, iterative statistical methods, principles in graphical analyses, simulation and Monte Carlo methods, generation of random variables, stochastic modeling, importance sampling, numberical and Monte Carlo Integration.
