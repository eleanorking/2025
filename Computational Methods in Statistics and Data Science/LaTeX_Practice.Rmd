```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(bench)
```

## Setup

If you have not installed the `tidyverse` collection of packages, you should
receive a prompt at the top of your editor window to do so. We will also need the `bench` package.

You can verify that they are installed by clicking on the "Knit" button in the
tool bar of the editing window.

## Problem 1 (2 pts)

### Part (a) (1 pt)

The following block of text is adapted from the [Wikipedia page on R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)). If you look at the source code for this document (the .Rmd file), you will see that the text is in HTML format. Your job is to recreate the RMarkdown I used to create this formatting.

- [Markdown basics](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) 
- The `Help > Cheatsheets > R Markdown Cheat Sheet` menu option
* You may find it easiest to copy the text from the rendered HTML into this .Rmd file, and then perform the necessary formatting.
* For the block of R code, **you do not need to actually execute this code**. (Use `eval = FALSE` in the chunk header)
* The Mandelbrot image can be found at `https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/Mandelbrot_Creation_Animation.gif/400px-Mandelbrot_Creation_Animation.gif`

<h3>Mandelbrot set</h3>
<p>Short R code calculating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set">Mandelbrot set</a> through the first 20 iterations of equation <span class="math inline">\(z = z^2 + c\)</span> plotted for different complex constants <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>. This example demonstrates:</p>
<ul>
<li>use of <strong>community-developed</strong> external libraries (called packages), in this case caTools package</li>
<li>handling of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_numbers">complex numbers</a></li>
<li>multidimensional arrays of numbers used as basic data type, see variables <code>C</code>, <code>Z</code> and <code>X</code>.</li>

### Part (b) (1 pt)

In this section we will use RMarkdown's math notation system. If you have encountered LaTeX's math notation, you will find it very familiar (though I am not expecting students to be know this system). 

[Cosma Shazili's reference](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/rmarkdown/#math-in-r-markdown) is a very helpful reference for notation commonly used in statistics.

In following, replace the `\ldots` in the prompts with appropriate math notation.

By default, all characters are treated as single letter variable names:

\[
2x + yz
\]

Write the expression for a line "y = m x + b":

\[
y = mx + b
\]


All commands (sometimes called "macros") for this language use `\` followed by the name of the command, and zero or more arguments enclosed in curly braces `{...}`. Some examples:

* $\pi$
* $\sqrt{x}$
* $\frac{x}{y}$

We can add subscripts (`_`) and superscripts (`^`) to variables: $X_i^2$.

Write the function "f" that computes Euclidean distance:

![](euclidean.png)
\[
f(x,y) = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

Many convenient notations for things like sums and integrals have ranges. These are achieved by using a subscript and a superscript on the command:

\[
e^x = \sum_{i=0}^\infty \frac{x^i}{i!} 
\]

Notice that to achieve the $i = 0$ in the subscript we had to wrap it in curly braces: `{i = 0}`.

The `\int` command is similar to sum. Use it to notate the area under the curve of the function $\sin(x)/\cos(x)$ from 0 to $\pi/4$.
