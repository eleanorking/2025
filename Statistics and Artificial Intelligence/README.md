**DATASCI 315: Statistics and Artificial Intelligence**

Statistical concepts are increasingly integrated into Artificial Intelligence applications, which often draw on a large amount of data received, transmitted, and generated by computers or networks of computers. This course introduces students to statistical and machine learning techniques such as deep neural networks, with applicattions to analyzing text and image data.

Projects:

- Gradient Descent and Logistic Regression (numpy, pandas, matplotlib)
- Mini Batch Gradient Descent (numpy, pandas, matplotlib)
- Recurrent Neural Networks and Natural Language Processing (scikit-learn, keras, tensorflow, numpy, matplotlib)
- Convolutional Neural Networks - Image Processing, Edge Detection, Blurring (scipy, numpy, matplotlib)
- Two Layer Neural Network (numpy, tensorflow)
- Regularization Methods (tensorflow, numpy, keras, matplotlib)
- Convolutional Neural Network Modeling in Tensorflow (tensorflow, keras, matplotlib)
